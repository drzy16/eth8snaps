This release contains a zip file with a csv file inside it listing all ETH addresses qualified for a total of 1 billion DAO tokens airdrop.
If you own at least 0.01 ETH at any of the blocks above, your address should be in the list and you will be able to claim your share in the DAO.

There are no premine (except for 1 token that will be needed to do housekeeping tasks during launch).
There are 7,426,219 Ethereum accounts that will qualify although we dont' expect all these account will take part in the DAO.
